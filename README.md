# The Solar System
The Solar System is an educational website based on the Planets that are orbiting our Sun (Pluto is also included). The website is easy to navigate and the demographic it would be aimed at would be pre - early teens. The information is provided in bullet points along with images and is not too technical. This will make the content easy to digest and engaging.

The site uses a main page with the images of the sun and planets on it for use of navigation.
